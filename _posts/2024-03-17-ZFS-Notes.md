Just some random notes on how to setup ZFS.

## ZFS on Linux

When setting up a zpool you specify disks in a way that remains consistent across reboots and systems. Reading https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Persistent_block_device_naming#by-id_and_by-path it mentions that the wwn-XXXX names should be the fully persistent.

## ZFS Permissions:

```bash

zfs mount mypool/myzfs
chown myuser:mygroup /mypool/myzfs
```
